# Hand to point mapper for Handscaper

## How to use:
To run the app, make sure you have a Python 3.x version installed, then simply open the ```install_requirements.bat``` file if you're on Windows, or run the ```install_requirements.sh``` file if you're on macOS or Linux. This will install all the required Python modules.

You can run the program with ```python app.py```. If the program crashes, try changing the index of the webcam in ```app.py``` in the line <br>```cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)```
